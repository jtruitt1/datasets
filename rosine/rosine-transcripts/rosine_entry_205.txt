She was bornin England & her Mother died when she was nineyears old - She lived at home till she was 12 yearsold and then Meeting with some Girls who werecoming to America she resolved to accompanythem, and to get the means took the moneyfrom her Fathers desk - He was a Sadler in goodbusiness, and stored his guineas in the desk.The money she took amounted to 15 [pounds] 5 shillingsand with this she paid her fare and had someover when she arrive in New York - She thenapprenticed herself to a Cap Maker and workedat that business some time but 6 weeks beforeshe was 13 she married Ernest Eiker a GermanShomaker of 29 - He was in good business, andowned the House he lived in - They lived happilytogether, and had 5 children - But unfortunatelythey rented some rooms in the House topersons, who were in the habit of treating & beingtreated and as she was social with them,the Landlady had to have her health drank sooften that she began to crave the Stimulant andand privately took her own JulepsHer Husband was a proud Man and was notwilling for her to associate with the Tenants but theywere there, and the temptation was growing uponher - At last he found her drunk in one of theirrooms and became so initated that he struckher for the first time and kicked and abusedher - But the die was cast - She was a Drunkardand blows and kicks could not reform her -He tried it often, but things grew worse, & worse.The Care of the family, and children devolved uponthe hired girl, as sometimes, she would not besober for a week together - At last he resolvedto come to [Philadelphia], to try if a new place wouldinduce her to do better, but after staying 15months here, his Sister came from Germany, & heconcluded to take her for Housekeeper, and movedback with all the Children to his own House [number]52 Leonard Street New York - The day HerHusband left, he had her taken up in the morning,and put in Prison, and when she returnedthe Shop was empty but he left her all the householdfurniture. She was now in utter despairher Babe was only nine months old and shefelt her [Crossed out: utter] entire desolation. She had nothing nowbut Rum, Rum, Rum! The Glass was again to her lipsthey had kept 1/2 dozen Journey Shomakers, asBoarders, and her husband probably thought shewould continue to keep them, and thus supportherself, but she was furious between grief, & liquor,and drove the Boarders from her house - Thenext day the Auctioneer was called, and all thegoods sold, and then it was drink, drink,till all was gone, and Baker Street becameher refuge, and the Prison her only resting place.Prostitution became her only means of procuringthe liquid poison that maddened her, and renderedher desperate - At this period she recieveda letter from a Cousin of her in New York, saying,a Woman had come from Germany with threechildren, who was the real wife of her Husband.He had deserted them 12, or 13, years before &Martha had lived with him as a wife 10years - She could sink no lower than shehad, but this was another stroke upon her heartwhen she was sober enough to realize hercondition - but she was never sober if shecould help it - M Townsend saw her threetimes in the Prison and though she knew not theparticulars of her fate she was attracted by the lovlinessof her countenance for she was still beautiful andthe softness and gentleness of her manners -At last hope sprung up in her heart andresolution came to make an effort to be oncemore a Woman - The missionary Gentlemenencouraged her to come and she has nowbeen a month in the Rosine - May shehave strength to persevere
