Her Husbandis named James Henry Taylor and has been going as Matein different vessels. A year ago he left her in a boardingHouse and went to California, since when she hasnot heard of him - She worked a while in a cotton milland became acquainted with 2 girls, Mary Ann Thomas,Sarah Ann Davis, who led her to drinking, and intobad houses, and she went rapidly down to destruction.During the Summer they worked in the neck at Trucking,and when that failed they gave themselves upto the debauchery of 7th & Bedford Streets - She & 3other miserable creatures came up together from there.
