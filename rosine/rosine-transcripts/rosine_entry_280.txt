Anne Morris came 12/10 1858. Her Parentslive in Boston, and she came on with a marriedSister, and lived a while with her. She thenlearned the Millinery business, and after wardsworked in a Cotton factory - While workingthere she was seduced by Edward Warner, aMachinist in Norris Factory - She still associatedwith him, and worked in a Cotton Mill,until they quarreled because he would notmarry her - Work becoming slack in theMill, She had nothing to do, and not beingable to pay her board she went to a poor Woman,near Fair Mount, who took her in - after a fewdays she walked out to look for work, &when she returned the Woman had moved, & takenall her clothes with her and as the woman owedrent, & had moved to escape paying it, the othertenants would not let her remain in thehouse, and she had no place to go to, as her Sister,Catharine Thompson had moved to Norristown -Therefore her only resort was to creep upan alley, and sleep in a Privy - This shedid two nights when some one directedher to the Rosine - She came almost frozenand smelling dreadfully
