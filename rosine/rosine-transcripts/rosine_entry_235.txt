Anne Walker came soon after her Motherin March & remained in the House 4 monthswhen she went out, staid 3 weeks & returned8/8 1856 - Her Father left her Mother & enlistedwhen she was only a month old & died away.Her Mother then married a Lawyer who alsodied in Manchester England - Her Motherhad taken to drink and probably on thataccount came over to [Philadelphia] where shehad a Sister living a Mrs Jamison a confectionerin Lombard [Street] above 13th - TheMother went out nursing and Annewas hired out at two or three places -Two years since her Mother took a roompretending to go out sewing but after a whileAnne found that her Mother went withMen to Assignation Houses - after a whileshe began to bring them home telling themshe had a young Daughter of 16 - For a whileshe tried in vain to corrupt Anne, but sherefused to have any thing to do with the Menher Mother brought - For this she beat &abused her, telling her if she would onlydo as she wished her to, she might be a Ladyand make her Mother one - Poor Anne atlast, weary of the persecution she endured andenticed by the Men yielded reluctantly - Afterwardher Mother took her to various assignationhouses, and at last broke up roomkeeping and took her to board with [Mary Cline]- From there they went to other houses,as her Mothers habits of intemperance wereso bad, that the Women were afraid tokeep her fearing their houses would be indited -Anne says she never wished to leada bad life, and hearing of the Rosine shecame hoping to keep clear of her Motherfor whom she feels almost a hatred knowingher to be the sole cause of her ruin.The Mother was here a short time beforeAnne came, but is now generally in thePrison - The poor child says she knowsthat she would not be out many hours beforeher Mother would find her and drag her againto perdition.
