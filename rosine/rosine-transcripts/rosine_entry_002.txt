Two Members of the R A called at the 
Mayors office, with Judge Kelly to see a 
couple of girls both in their 17th year, who had 
been induced by a couple of Soldiers to join a 
company that was going to Mexico - They 
had entered as Laundresses in the army and 
were to leave the next morn, when Judge Kelly 
hearing of their cases withdrew them from the 
rendesvous, and took them for Safe Keeping to 
the Mayors office, where they continued until 
they were taken in charge by these Ladies - 
The Rosine House not being yet in operation 
they remained with one of them some 
time, when they were restored to their parents.
