Anne Bradley, or Oneal came 12/26/1856 -Her Father died when she was 7 years old. Sheexpects her Mother is still living. She has beenmarried, but her husband has left her, andshe knows nothing of him, which is not to bewondered at, as Anne's tongue and temper areterrible - She has lived at service butcame here through intemperance -
