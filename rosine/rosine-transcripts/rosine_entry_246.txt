Henry Vandyke Rowan is the Father of HenriettaRowan. They have lived in Tinicumand he is a Common laborer. She had aSister married to a Man named Daniel Reeves,(but her Sister is dead) in Christian Street backof [number] 66. Her Father, & Brother both used thetwo Children for the indulgence of their passions,and she had a child when she was only13 years - She says she never had connectionwith any body but them until the last week.Her Father in a drunken spree turned both ofthem out and they came to the city - TheSister got a place at a Mrs Browns MeadAlley - She went to her Brother in law D. Reeveswhere she staid a week. They got her a placebut she did not understand the work &was discharged. She then concludedto go in the Baltimore car, to her Sister,who is married to a Man namedJohnson, in Brandywine hundred, butshe found she had not money enough to payher passage so she fell into discourse witha Man named Jem Donnelly a Driverof one of the Omnibuss. He told her if shewould stay with him that night the nextday he would get her a boarding house.He then took her to a Barn where he staidwith her - There were two other Menthere, and all of them used her - Thenext night she spent in the Barnalso, and the next day a police manseeing her hanging round, got to questioningher, and hearing her story took herto the Mayors Office, and [William Mullen] seeingher, they concluded to bring her to the Rosine.But she seems to have little or no sense ofthe wickedness of such a life, and saysshe wants to go back to Jem, for he promisedto pay her Board - The poor foolish childgave him her clothes to take care of for her
