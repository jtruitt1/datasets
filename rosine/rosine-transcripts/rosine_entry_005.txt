[underlined] 6th [/underlined]C C, a Member of the R A, had reason to believea young woman who lived with her had been improperlyconnected with a Young Man. At firstthe Girl denied it, but afterward confessed it wastrue - C C immediately went to the Young Man,spoke with him upon the subject, and urgedhim to marry her - As he did not seem disposedto act justly towards the Girl, C C put the caseunder the care of one of the Guardians of the poorwho went with her to meet him, and in a short timethe marriage was accomplished, and the delightedgirl threw her arms around her protectress, &with tears of gratitude thanked her for her kindinterference-   This case is recordedto show how much may be done by a benevolentenergetic Woman, who, instead of turning herdomestic out of the house with harshness, feltthat she had something to do for her erring Sisterand with a Womans heart put herself to thework, and accomplished it - May it bea useful lesson to our Members, and others -
