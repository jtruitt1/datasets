Margaret Wilson came [January] 5th 1856. M Thad recieved a note from a Missionary tocall on Margaret in St. Marys Street. Shewas out, but M left a message, and a RosineBook for her - This she read and resolvedto come and now at this period 8/15 has been8 months in the house - She has been threeyears from Ireland, near Newtown, Lymvaddy [Limavady]County Derry - Her Mother Hannah Wilsonlives on a Farm there - She left home, havingheard so much of America that she resolved tocome and seek her fortune. On arrivingshe got a situation with J C Mitchel a Lawyeron 6th [above] Walnut where she lived a longtime - Taking offence at a trifle she leftthere, and lived with a Mrs Barclay, butnot being settled there, she left, and stoppedat a house to enquire for a place to board tillshe got another place - The woman took herin, and at the time she had no suspicionof any wrong, but in the evening two Mencame there and they had wine and mademerry but alas a sad morning followedas poor Margaret found she was a ruined Girl.Ashamed to show her face in the Street she remainedthere as she had not courage to go to a decenthouse to look for a place and the Man continuedto come to see here - But he soon got board forher at St. Mary's [Street] - Several Girls boarded therewho were kept by Men, but they had to goto assignation houses as they were not allowedto frequent the house - After a while she becamediseased, and Dr. Rizer cured her, but shefelt so unhappy that when she saw theMissionary she promised him she wouldleave as soon he would get a home for her.She seems to be a religious, good girl, &desires to do what is right
