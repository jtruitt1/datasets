While Julia Mc D was at the Alms House
She became interested for another Young
Woman who was there under similar
circumstances, with the one just spoken of -

Again she wrote to M T, appealing to her
sympathies for this unfortunate - She was
visited, and appearing to be a Girl who desired
to do rightly, she was invited, if she had
no home to recieve her, to come to the house
of M, and something should be done for her -
Accordingly, feeling friendless, and homeless,
when she left the Alms House she accepted
the shelter that had been offered her - No suitable
situation presenting, she has continued
in the family, and shown by her correct deportment,
and grateful conduct that the erring
may be restored, and that kind and proper
treatment may save the wanderer from the
path of Virtue, and that of others - She says, the word
of M T, when at the Alms House, gave her the first
ray of hope that she could again hold a station
in Respectable Society - Her conduct has
been worthy of praise during the four months
she has been in the family, and M T feels, she
has been to her, a blessing - Her grateful
and affectionate behaviour, and the prospect
of her continued usefulness, and respectability
cheer the mind under some of the discouragements
that we meet, and enable us to persevere
in endeavoring to save those who have
erred, but desire again to act rightly.
