          [underlined] Case 1st [/underlined]

Julia McDonald was the first case 
under the care of the Members of the Rosine
Association - 
     She was the Daughter of an Irish Gentleman 
of good family but was left an orphan at 7 
years of age. Placed in a family where she 
recieved no moral, nor religious teaching, she 
reached the age of 15 with little definite 
knowledge of right, or wrong - She then left 
them & lived in various situations in [New York],
untill she was about 17 when she was 
seduced by the Manager of the [New York Theatre] - 
For Several Years she led a varied life, Sometimes 
an Actress, then looking honestly for a living 
for months together in an house of ill fame, 
and again, striving to do rightly, but by constant 
discovery & the apparent force of circumstance, 
thrown back to an evil course of life - In a 
determined Struggle to reform, She entered the 
Magdalen in [New York], and came from there 
to the Philadelphia Magdalen Asylum - She was there
several months, but becoming dissatisfied, left, & in 
a Short time Returned to the Same abandoned
mode of life - Gradually she contracted a habit 
of drinking which prevented all permanent 
success in the work of reform. One of the 
Members of the Rosine Association met with 
her in the Moyamensing prison where she had 
been committed as a vagrant - Several efforts 
were made to produce a reformation in her 
habits, and we have reason to believe she was 
Sincere in desiring it herself, but the love of excitement
had so grown upon her that a steady 
quiet home became irksome & the craving for 
liquor drew her back - The House of her 
friends, the dram shop, the prison & the Alms 
House were alternately her homes for a year - 
During the Summer of [1847] She hoped to become 
an inmate of the Rosine House, and in the 
mean time worked in a Muff Store, but 
not being able to earn more than enough to 
pay her board she had to pledge her clothing 
to purchase Shoes, etc., Becoming discouraged 
under these circumstances, and believing 
it was hopeless to try to reform she took 
Laudenum, and thus closed her sad 
and eventful life - When the Laudenum 
was taking effect upon her, a person 
asked her if she was going to sleep - She 
replied Yes! I am going to sleep now, but 
I shall awake in Hell
