Sarah Youndt came from Baltimore 10/4 [1852]Her Mother Sarah Ann Youndt lives in Preston [Street] nearMadison [Street] Baltimore - Her parents parted when shewas eleven years old. Her Father drank, and wasa bad Man in other respects - He was a Hatterand could earn from 15 to 18 dollars a week butneglected his business. Her Mother owned severalhouses, and was well off when they married, but hewasted every thing, and when his wife set up a cake& Bread Store he would throw the cakes in the fireto prevent her making a living - He thus endeavoredto destroy her happiness in every way [Inserted: until at last they separated] - Her Mothersince then has been in very poor health and has supportedherself and 4 children by going out nursing, &taking in sewing - They make Monkey Jackets, &other coats, for which they get by 20 or 25 [cents] -They cannot make more than one a day, and outof this food, raiment, and house rent is to come -Sometimes they have been three days without food.Her elder Sister turned out badly - Her healthwas wretched, she raised blood and close workand starvation were sad temptations to try anothercourse of life - She is now living in that manner -Sarah worked in a factory at Ellicotts Mills, and cameinto Baltimore occasionally - At one time she was onher way to see her Father, when she stopped at a Confectioners,in a cellar, or Basement - He very politely shewedher his wares, and then drew her attention to something in a roomback of his Shop. When he closed the door, and grasping a largeknife told her would kill her if she resisted him. Hethen threw her on a bed and grasping her round the throatwith one hand, accomplished his wicked purpose -When he was ready he let her go, with the feeling of degradationin her heart - She told her Father what had occurred, & heprosecuted the Man, but as usual in such cases nothingwas done - But the story got out among her acquaintancesin the Factory, with additions and alterations,and her feeling were so hurt and mortified thatshe left there, and entered a factory in Baltimore.But the Story followed her there, and she changedagain, but the factory girls followed her, and her imaginationprobably distorted some of their actions, &made things appear worse to her than they reallywere - Changing so often, and being sometimes outof employment, left her without funds to meet herboard & other expenses - Want, shame, and thenervous excitement, [Crossed out: brought on] occasioned by these occurrences,brought on a feeling of hopelessness of ever being ableto rise above her present troubles - In the meantimeher Sister appeared to be doing finely, and flaunted ingay apparel, while she had not clothes to be decent -Oh! the sore temptations to a young girl in this tryingsituation - Her Fathers misconduct had perhaps predisposedto weakness, and her Mothers troubles and her ownhad not served to implant principle or give strengthsto her better feelings - Thus circumstanced she entereda house of bad character, where she remained some timewhen happening one night to go to Methodist Meetingher feelings were excited, and she went up to be prayedfor. Some of the Ladies came round her, and to them sherevealed her situation, and where she lived - They wentto see her, and having heard of the Rosine through FrancisKing, they persuaded her to come -She was in the Rosine three or four Weeks, butappeared to be in a state of great nervous excitement,and in addition to this, thought she was diseased,and in the family Way - She appeared sounhappy and desirous of returning to her Motherthat M Hastings put her in the car and sent her home.
