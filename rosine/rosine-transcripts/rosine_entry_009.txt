Page 1   [underlined] 10th [/underlined]Ruth Anna May entered the Rosine InstitutionShe is the daughter of Parents highlyrespected, but an unfortunate second marriage on herMothers side was the means of weaning her from herHome & at the age 19 she engaged with some strolling actorand started for the West unknown to her friends.It appears from her own confession, for 8 years Sheled a wandering abandoned life, reckless of friends orcharacter. The Theatre, the Circus & the Billiard Roomalternately was the scene of her associations, untill byloose habits of improper exposure in dress she becamethe child of affliction and sorrow - from the New YorkHospital she was brought to our Alms house. By theurgent solicitation of her family, who had found theirlost one, who appeared truly Penitent the Managersconsented to receive her into the Institution althoughher diseased state precluded her from the benefits ofthis society -   But her desire for a quiet, happyhome, an an assurance of aiding as far as her healthwould permit the interests of the house, induced us to openthis aslum to her where we hope she may encrease in Strengthand Divine Grace & we May become Mutual helpers toeach other. -
