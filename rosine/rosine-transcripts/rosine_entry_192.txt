Mary Ann McMahan came 10/17 - Her Father livesin Newark [New Jersey] and is a Hatter Thomas McMahan -Her Mother died when she was 13 & herFather Married again - She and her step Motherdid not agree, as she wanted to run out intocompany but she says she never did anythingwrong but her Father thought she had and broughther to the Magdalen where she staid six monthsand then ran away with Jane Berry - They weretaken back together, and Mary Ann staid twomonths longer, when she ran off with anotherGirl, who told her she would take her home with her,but it resulted in her taking her to Pete Fosters whokeeps a Tavern, and Girls, in Richmond. Thereshe staid 2 weeks, and was with 6 or 8 Men.On First day morn the 16 she heard there was arowdy set coming for a frolic to the House and shefelt so unhappy, she concluded to take a walkto get out of their way and wandered out towardsFairmount. On her way she saw some people ina Meeting so she went in, and sat with themThey were singing a Hymn her Mother had taught her in childhood It fell upon her ear asa magic spell, & she called up the memoriesof innocence and love, till her heart overflowed.After the Meeting she wandered alone till the afternoonMeeting, and then she went there again. Itwas in a shed, but it was a Bethel to her.She resolved she would never return to theHouse, she had left, and as she had heardof the Rosine, while in the Magdalen, she enquiredof some Men in the street where the Rosinewas, and one of them brought her to the House.
