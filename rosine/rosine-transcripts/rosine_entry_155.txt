Shelived with them till she was 14 when she went towork in a cotton factory near the Schuylkill -Devoignes factory. After working there awhileshe went to another factory 12th & Willow & thento a place or Service in the country & afterwardsto another towards Kensington - A young mannamed Robert Vanskiver paid attention to herand she supposed he wished marriage. Heis the Captain of one of the Salem Steam BoatsOne evening she was standing at the door andhe stopped, and asked her to take a walk.She went with him and he managed to prolongthe walk and took her down to [Mammy Smiths]in Blackberry Alley - She had nosuspicion of the house and thought she wasgoing to get ice cream - He called for creamand it was brought and for wine and insistedon her drinking - She became very sick, andthe woman told her she had better lie downtill she got better, and took her upstairs -She did as she was throwing up continually -A few minutes after Vanskiver came up, andamid all her sickness, and tears, and entreatiesperpetrated his brutal desire - She continuedvery sick all night, and in the morning he triedto persuade her to stay at the house, and he wouldpay her board - About ten in the morn shefelt better and left the house and she has neverseen him since - Mammy Smith told her hehad told them before he went up stairs, not to mindit if she did scream, and make a noise, so thebrutal wretch had probably ruined others, and knewhow it could probably be - At ten o'clock she left,but could not bear to go back to her place as shehad been out all night - She therefore wanderedabout not knowing where to go but going outtowards Fairmount met one of the Factory girls sheknew and staid with her till next day - Shethen concluded to go out to the place where she hadlived in the country but having no change of clothingshe had to return, and went to the Magdalen - Butshe was not satisfied there, and while there, heard of theRosine - After being there a month she left, and wentback to her place but they had another girl and didnot need her - So she concluded to come to theRosine
