# The Rosine Association

The Rosine Association, based in Philadelphia in the 1840s and 1850s, was "a house for the reformation, employment and instruction of women, who had led immoral lives." The Rosine Association served women who struggled with addiction, domestic violence, and/or sexual assault; women who may have engaged in sex work and other criminalized economies; women who challenged the gender and racial binaries of their times; in short, women who lived at the margins of society. 

There are two extant casebooks for the Rosine Association, dating from 1848 to 1858, and possibly spanning the entire life of the organization. Typical entries provide basic biographical information about each woman, her family situation, challenges that led her to seek out or be referred to the Association, and the circumstances surrounding her departure. The casebooks are extraordinary, unique sources for understanding the lives of women who are usually excluded from documentary records.

The casebooks are stored at the Friends Historical Library of Swarthmore College as part of the [Mira Sharpless Townsend Papers (RG5/320)](http://archives.tricolib.brynmawr.edu/resources/sfhl-rg5-320) and [scans of the casebooks are available online](https://digitalcollections.tricolib.brynmawr.edu/collections/mira-sharpless-townsend-papers). This dataset was compiled in 2020-2021 to facilitate understanding and use of their important historical contents.
