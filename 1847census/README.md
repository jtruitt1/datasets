## About the census
In 1847, a committee of Quakers appointed by the Meeting for Sufferings of Philadelphia Yearly Meeting (Orthodox) set out to document Philadelphia's African American residents. The purpose of the committee initially was to prepare a report on the slave trade, but after further consideration, the committee determined that it was also important to examine the condition of the African-American population of Philadelphia both to document the existence of an "industrious and thriving" portion of that population and to discover what portion of the community may have been in need of attention and assistance. Their survey was distilled into a 44 page report published as _A Statistical Inquiry into the Condition of the People of Colour of the City and Districts of Philadelphia_ (1849). 

In 2002 the Friends Historical Library created an [online exhibit about the study](https://web.archive.org/web/20200119083733/http://www.swarthmore.edu/Library/friends/paac1847/beforeyoubegin.html), including a scan of the report.
